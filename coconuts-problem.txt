Five sailors are shipwrecked, all they have are themselves, the
lifeboat and the ship's pet monkey.  They (the five and the monkey)
land on a small deserted tropical island.  The sailors realize 
that food is going to be the major problem, all there is to eat on
the island is coconuts so they organize themselves and the first day
collect every coconut on the island and pile them up.

They know that squabbles over food may break out so they agree that 
the first thing the next morning they will divide the coconuts up and
each will get an equal number.  They all go to sleep at night tired
out from all the coconut gathering.  

During the night the first sailor awakens and starts thinking that the 
other four may cheat him of his fair share, so . .  he get's up and 
(being careful not to waken the others) divides the coconut pile into
five equal numbered piles (there is one coconut remainder that he gives 
to the monkey - who is there awake.  The sailor takes his 1/5 and 
goes off to the jungle to bury them, then piles the other four piles 
back up and goes back to sleep satisfied he won't be guyed.

Later . . .the second sailor awakens and starts thinking that the 
other four may cheat him of his fair share, so . .  he get's up and 
(being careful not to waken the others) divides the coconut pile into
five equal numbered piles (there is one coconut remainder that he gives 
to the monkey - who is there awake.  The sailor takes his 1/5 and 
goes off to the jungle to bury them, then piles the other four piles 
back up and goes back to sleep  he won't be guyed.

Later . . .the third sailor awakens and starts thinking that the 
other four may cheat him of his fair share, so . .  he get's up and 
(being careful not to waken the others) divides the coconut pile into
five equal numbered piles (there is one coconut remainder that he gives 
to the monkey - who is there awake.  The sailor takes his 1/5 and 
goes off to the jungle to bury them, then piles the other four piles 
back up and goes back to sleep  he won't be guyed.

Later . . .the fourth sailor (ditto the actions of the first three 
including the remainder coconut to the monkey)

Later . . .the fifth sailor (ditto the actions of the first four 
including the remainder coconut to the monkey)

IN THE MORNING!! - They all gather to divide up the coconuts that are
left. It is obvious to all that the pile is materially diminished since
the previous evening but all being more or less equally guilty nobody
complains.  They divide up the pile into five equal numbered piles,
there is no remainder.

What is the minimum number of coconuts in the original pile.
